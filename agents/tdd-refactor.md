# TDD Refactor Phase - Improve Quality & Security

Clean up code, apply security best practices, and enhance design whilst keeping all tests green and maintaining GitHub issue compliance.

## Project Context

- **FLEXT projects (mandatory)**: Before refactoring, load `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/flext-patterns`, `flext-strict-typing`, `flext-refactoring-workflow`.
  - **Integral Changes**: If refactor touches type/model/signature boundaries across projects, update ALL references via ast-grep.
  - **Quality Gates**: After refactor, `make check PROJECT=<affected>` MUST pass on all touched projects with ZERO errors/warnings/suppressions.
  - **SOLID + FLEXT**: Apply SOLID + MRO namespace discipline (c/m/p/t/u aliases, organic nesting, no flattening).
  - **Anti-Patterns**: Remove `model_rebuild()`, `cast()`, `Any`, bare `except:`, direct pydantic imports.
  - **200-Line Cap**: No module/class/method/function >200 code lines (measured via tokei, logical LOC only). Refactor via OO composition + MRO inheritance.

## Strict Python policy

Apply `~/.agents/rules/python.md` (SSOT) for typing, Pydantic 2 / Python 3.13, Protocol-first / DSL / fail-loud rules and workspace-wide validation gates. Net LOC negative for every refactor.

## GitHub Issue Integration

### Issue Completion Validation

- **Verify all acceptance criteria met** - Cross-check implementation against GitHub issue requirements
- **Update issue status** - Mark issue as completed or identify remaining work
- **Document design decisions** - Comment on issue with architectural choices made during refactor
- **Link related issues** - Identify technical debt or follow-up issues created during refactoring

### Quality Gates

- **Definition of Done adherence** - Ensure all issue checklist items are satisfied
- **Security requirements** - Address any security considerations mentioned in issue
- **Performance criteria** - Meet any performance requirements specified in issue
- **Documentation updates** - Update any documentation referenced in issue

## Core Principles

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Remove duplication** - Extract common code into reusable methods or classes
- **Improve readability** - Use intention-revealing names and clear structure aligned with issue domain
- **Apply SOLID principles** - Single responsibility, dependency inversion, etc.
- **Simplify complexity** - Break down large methods, reduce cyclomatic complexity

### Security Hardening

- **Input validation** - Sanitise and validate all external inputs per issue security requirements
- **Authentication/Authorisation** - Implement proper access controls if specified in issue
- **Data protection** - Encrypt sensitive data, use secure connection strings
- **Error handling** - Avoid information disclosure through exception details
- **Dependency scanning** - Check for vulnerable packages (`npm audit`, `pip audit`, `dotnet list package --vulnerable`, etc.)
- **Secrets management** - Use environment variables or a secrets manager; never hard-code credentials
- **OWASP compliance** - Address security concerns mentioned in issue or related security tickets

### Design Excellence

- **Design patterns** - Apply appropriate patterns (Repository, Factory, Strategy, etc.)
- **Dependency injection** - Use DI container or constructor injection for loose coupling
- **Configuration management** - Externalise settings using environment variables or config files
- **Logging and monitoring** - Add structured logging appropriate to your stack for issue troubleshooting
- **Performance optimisation** - Use async/await or equivalent concurrency primitives, efficient collections, caching

### Language Best Practices (Polyglot)

- **Null safety** - Enable strict null checks (TypeScript), nullable reference types (C#), or Optional types (Java/Kotlin)
- **Modern language features** - Use pattern matching, destructuring, and idiomatic constructs for your language
- **Memory & performance** - Apply language-specific optimisations only when profiling reveals a bottleneck
- **Error handling** - Use specific error/exception types; avoid swallowing errors silently

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Input validation on all public methods
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterised queries)
- [ ] XSS protection for web applications
- [ ] Authorisation checks on sensitive operations
- [ ] Secure configuration (no secrets in code)
- [ ] Error handling without information disclosure
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 considerations addressed

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Review issue completion** - Ensure GitHub issue acceptance criteria are fully met
2. **Ensure green tests** - All tests must pass before refactoring
3. **Confirm your plan with the user** - Ensure understanding of requirements and edge cases. NEVER start making changes without user confirmation
4. **Small incremental changes** - Refactor in tiny steps, running tests frequently
5. **Apply one improvement at a time** - Focus on single refactoring technique
6. **Run security analysis** - Use static analysis tools (SonarQube, Checkmarx)
7. **Document security decisions** - Add comments for security-critical code
8. **Update issue** - Comment on final implementation and close issue if complete

## Refactor Phase Checklist

- [ ] GitHub issue acceptance criteria fully satisfied
- [ ] Code duplication eliminated
- [ ] Names clearly express intent aligned with issue domain
- [ ] Methods have single responsibility
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed per issue requirements
- [ ] Performance considerations applied
- [ ] All tests remain green
- [ ] Code coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] Issue marked as complete or follow-up issues created
- [ ] Documentation updated as specified in issue
